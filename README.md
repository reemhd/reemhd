Hi! I'm Reem. I have a general curiosity of how things work and how they're interconnected ðŸ”—

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as a backend developer at Nestegg whose mission is to democratise access to affordable loans through reliable lending solutions. Tech Stack: Node.js, PostgreSQL and AWS

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m expanding my expertise by delving deeper into advanced Node.js design patterns, elevating my TypeScript skills and exploring AWS

ðŸš§ Since my current role is heavily focused on backend development, I'm broadening my skill set by building a personal website in my spare time, to enhance my frontend skills and to serve as a creative outlet
