Hi! I'm Reem. I am currently based in Brighton, UK. I have a general curiosity of how things work and they're interconnected ðŸ”—

ðŸ”­ **Professionally** I'm working as a backend developer at Nestegg whose mission is to democratise access to affordable loans through reliable lending solutions. Tech Stack: Node.js, PostgreSQL and AWS
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my expertise by delving deeper into advanced Node.js design patterns, elevating my TypeScript skills and exploring AWS
ðŸš§ Since my current role is heavily focused on backend development, I'm broadening my skill set by building a personal website in my spare time to enhance my frontend skills but also serves as a creative outlet
