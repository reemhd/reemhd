Hi! I'm Reem. I have am innate curiosity of how things work and how they're interconnected 🔗

🔭 I'm currently working as a backend developer at Nestegg whose mission is to democratise access to affordable loans through reliable lending solutions. Tech Stack: Node.js, PostgreSQL and AWS

🌱 I’m expanding my expertise by delving deeper into advanced Node.js design patterns, elevating my TypeScript skills and exploring AWS

🚧 Since my current role is heavily focused on backend development, I'm broadening my skill set by building a personal website in my spare time, to enhance my frontend skills and to serve as a creative outlet
